# Sentry - AI-Powered Log Anomaly Detection

## Overview

Sentry is a TypeScript-based web application for AI-powered security log anomaly detection. It analyzes security logs, specifically Zscaler NSS feed format, using OpenAI's GPT-4o model to identify threats. The system handles log upload, processing, anomaly detection, risk scoring, and dashboard analytics with user authentication. Sentry aims to provide a comprehensive solution for proactive security threat identification with high confidence.

**Production Development Protocol

**New Feature Development Process:**
1. **Always propose first** - Present multiple options with tradeoffs before implementing anything new
2. **Evaluate tradeoffs together** - Discuss pros/cons of each approach with user
3. **Get explicit approval** - Only implement after user selects preferred option
4. **Fix critical errors immediately** - Address LSP errors, build failures, or system crashes without waiting
5. **Focus on stability** - Prioritize system reliability over new features in production environment

**Option Presentation Format:**
- Present 2-3 viable approaches for each new feature/enhancement
- Include: implementation complexity, performance impact, maintenance burden, user experience impact
- Highlight recommended approach with reasoning
- Wait for user decision before proceeding
