# Local Development Setup

## Database Setup (Completed âœ…)

Your local PostgreSQL database has been successfully provisioned and configured:

### What Was Done:
1. **Database Provisioned**: Local PostgreSQL database created
2. **Environment Variables Set**: DATABASE_URL and other DB credentials added
3. **Schema Migration**: Database schema successfully pushed using `npm run db:push`
4. **Conflicts Resolved**: Removed old table structures that conflicted with current schema

### Database Connection Details:
- The DATABASE_URL environment variable is now available
- All necessary PostgreSQL credentials are configured
- Database schema includes all tables: users, sessions, log_files, anomalies, processing_jobs, etc.

### Next Steps for Local Development:
```bash
# The application should now run locally without database errors
npm run dev
```

### Troubleshooting:
- If you see database connection errors, verify the DATABASE_URL environment variable is set
- The database is ready and contains the correct schema structure
- All authentication and core functionality should work locally

### Files Created/Modified:
- `.env` - Contains DATABASE_URL and database credentials
- Database schema successfully aligned with `shared/schema.ts`

Your local development environment is now ready! ðŸš€
